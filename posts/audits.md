In order to make sure the eduVPN software is safe and secure we've asked the 
Digital Security Group of Radboud University to review our software 
architecture and the eduVPN server source code. This audit was finished 
recently and fortunately only some minor issues were found.

The Windows eduVPN client was recently audited by Fox-IT (NCC group). They 
did a source code audit and only found some minor issues. We've of course 
fixed these.

The full audit reports are available on request.
