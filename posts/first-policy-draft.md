On one hand eduVPN is a full open-source project, leveraging any organisation 
to deploy a large scale VPN service themselves. On the other side we're 
actively working to make eduVPN an official GÉANT service. Aiming to make 
eduVPN the default VPN ‘standard’ like eduroam is for WiFi.

Based on the November eduVPN workshop and eduroam best practices & experiences 
a first eduVPN policy draft has been written. The document is available below. 
Feedback is welcome!
