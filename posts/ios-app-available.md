The eduVPN apps for Windows, macOS and Android have been available for quite a 
while. It took us more time to release an iOS app. The difficulty was we could 
not use OpenVPN 2.x GPL software because of Apple policies. Fortunately, 
Private Internet Access has created an OpenVPN compatible ‘clone’ which we 
have audited and implemented in the iOS app. The iOS app is available here:

It is now a full app, which means that it is not required to use the OpenVPN 
app anymore.
