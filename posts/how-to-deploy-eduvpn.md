**UPDATE**: see [Documentation](../documentation.html) for up to date 
information on how to install eduVPN.

Currently the NRENs from Uganda, Denmark, Norway and the Netherlands have 
deployed an eduVPN server. At TNC18 we got questions about how to deploy 
eduVPN. 

The steps are:

1. [Deploy and install a VM](https://github.com/eduvpn/documentation/blob/master/README.md#deployment) 
   in order to get your own eduVPN instance. **NOTE**: Network equipment/VM 
   platform allows access to at the very least `tcp/80`, 
   `tcp/443`, `udp/1194` and `tcp/1194` for basic functionality;
2. connect the eduVPN instance to your 
   [SAML federation](https://github.com/eduvpn/documentation/blob/master/SAML.md);
3. contact [us](mailto:eduvpn-support@lists.geant.org) in order to "get in the 
   eduVPN apps";
