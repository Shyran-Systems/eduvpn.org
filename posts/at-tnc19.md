eduVPN will be present at [TNC19](https://tnc19.geant.org) in Tallinn on 17 and 
18 June.

The workshop on [Monday](https://tnc19.geant.org/programme/#Monday) morning is 
open to anyone who is interested in eduVPN. The event is scheduled from 
08:00 to 10:30 at _Terrace Hall_. We hope to answer your questions and hear 
your requirements. 

The workshop will also be place where the draft policy for guest access in 
eduVPN will become the official 
[policy](../download/eduVPN_Compliance_Statement_19122018.pdf).

**UPDATE**: find the 1.0 compliance statement, as discussed during TNC19, 
[here](../download/eduVPN_Compliance_Statement_1.0.pdf)!

Guest access describes the situation when users from an NREN use another NRENâ€™s 
instance to access the Internet. This is the use case that has raised most 
questions so far, so it is important that we agree on a common set of 
principles and rules. 

There will also be a more classic presentation on 
[Tuesday](https://tnc19.geant.org/programme/#Tuesday) afternoon during the 
_edu*_ session from 16:00 to 17:30 at _Small Hall_.

If you already have questions or feedback, please let us know at 
[eduvpn-support@lists.geant.org](mailto:eduvpn-support@lists.geant.org)!
