If you are interested in setting up your own eduVPN server and being listed in
our [apps](apps.html) make sure you are part of the (international) research
community. This means that you should be an NREN, research organization or 
educational institute.

If you are not the target audience of eduVPN, you can always use 
[Let's Connect!](https://letsconnect-vpn.org/) which is the same software, 
without the eduVPN _branding_.

Please [subscribe](https://list.surfnet.nl/mailman/listinfo/eduvpn-deploy) to 
the mailing list if you plan to run an eduVPN server. It will be used for 
announcements and discussion. An 
[archive](https://list.surfnet.nl/pipermail/eduvpn-deploy/) is also available.

Follow the 
[deployment](https://github.com/eduvpn/documentation/blob/master/README.md#deployment)
instructions to setup your server.
