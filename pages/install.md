This page describes the eduVPN _server_ installation. If you are looking for
the apps, look [here](apps.html). If you are not part of the (international) 
research community you can install and use 
[Let's Connect!](https://letsconnect-vpn.org/).

If you plan to set up your own eduVPN server:

1. [Subscribe](https://list.surfnet.nl/mailman/listinfo/eduvpn-deploy) to the
   "deployers" mailing list.
2. Decide on a platform to run eduVPN on. Currently 
   [CentOS](https://centos.org/), [Debian](https://debian.org/) and 
   [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/) are supported.
3. Follow the 
   [deployment](https://github.com/eduvpn/documentation/blob/master/README.md#deployment)
   instructions to setup your server.
4. [Contact](contact.html) us to have your server listed in our 
   [apps](apps.html).
