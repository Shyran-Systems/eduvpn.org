eduVPN is a VPN service provided for the international research and education 
community. It aims to offer both secure access to campus networks as well as 
the ability to be safer when using the Internet when 
[eduroam](https://www.eduroam.org/) is not available and you are relying on 
insecure WiFi networks to connect.

On this site you can read more about eduVPN, how to use it as an end-user 
through the [Apps](apps.html) and how to participate as an organization within
the community. Read our [Blog](blog/) to keep up to date with eduVPN!
