The purpose of eduVPN is to provide a more secure access to public and private 
networks for the international research and education community. The essential 
eduVPN user experience should be: "open your laptop and be securely online".

eduVPN service instances offered by NRENs or universities, research labs, etc., 
allow students, researchers and staff from participating institutions to obtain 
a VPN on their devices to known end-points.

eduVPN can be deployed in two main use cases:

- Secure and privacy preserving access from public networks: by providing 
  secure gateways to trusted networks that end-users can tunnel to when using 
  insecure networks (e.g. in particular public WiFi hotspots);
- Institute access to private networks: a "corporate" VPN solution, where 
  end-users can access internal resources within the internal network of their 
  university. In this case, eduVPN has similar functionalities as a typical 
  VPN concentrator box. The service can also be used to connect different 
  campuses or networks (VLANs) within a single institution.
