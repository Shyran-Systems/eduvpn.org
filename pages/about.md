In 2015, eduVPN started as a project at the Dutch research and education 
network [SURFnet](https://surfnet.nl/). SURFnet continues to play a leading 
role in the project, but now eduVPN is deployed in a number of countries: 
Australia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Morocco, The Netherlands, Norway, 
Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Uganda and Ukraine! 

eduVPN is currently a program under the 
[Commons Conservancy](https://commonsconservancy.org/), a non-for-profit 
foundation focusing on free and open source projects. It is also part of the 
[GÃ‰ANT](https://www.geant.org/) project (GN4-3) which is co-funded by the 
European Union.

It has received funding from the 
[Vietsch Foundation](http://www.vietsch-foundation.org/), 
[RIPE](https://www.ripe.net/) and the [NLnet Foundation](https://nlnet.nl/).
