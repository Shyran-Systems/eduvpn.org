eduVPN enables employees, researchers and students to easily and securely 
connect to the Internet and gain access to their institution's protected 
systems.

Many public Wi-Fi networks, for example, on the train, in the library or in 
restaurants, are unsecure, but your home network is not always well protected 
either. All the data you enter and receive on your phone, tablet or computer 
can be intercepted fairly easily. Malevolent people can also divert you to a 
phishing-website in order to intercept your password. Not a comforting thought! 
Certainly if you are processing sensitive information.

The eduVPN service resolves this by setting up a so-called Virtual Private 
Network (VPN), an encrypted connection between your (private) computer or 
smartphone and the company network of your organisation. It acts as a bridge, 
offering you direct network access. This will allow you to connect securely to 
the Internet without the fear of prying eyes close by.
